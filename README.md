# Sense-Game-Prototype

This is the game I'm currently working on.
It is a 2D game which uses a real-time combat system similar to the one found in the game "The World Ends With You" by Square Enix.
There will also be a story to explore where the characters will have to fight for their lives as Umbrals attack them from a different dimension.

Features:
- A story about a ghost and his shaman.
- A lot of different attacks and combos.
- Strengthen friendships with the people you meet.
- Learn module as you use them to fight enemies.
